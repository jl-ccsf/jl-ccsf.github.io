# Student Server

Hi, I'm Jules, and this is the home for my Spring 2026 portfolio.

## Purpose

This is where I'll be uploading my homework assignments for [CNIT-131A: Introduction to XML & JSON](https://www.ccsf.edu/academics/ccsf-catalog/courses-by-department/computer-networking-and-information-technology "Computer Networking & Information Technology Dept") throughout the semester. Check out my [portfolio-in-progress](https://jl-ccsf.github.io/cnit131a.html "CNIT-131A") and let me know what you think :bowtie:
